# Example 3. 

The objective of this exercise is to select from three possible types of control valves (the same valve but different cylinders) the most suitable for the operation of the system.

the conditions are as follows:

  - The diameter of the valve is smaller than the diameter of the pipes, and the piping system requires a constant flow,
  - the pressures vary both upstream and downstream of the valve, and
  - Initially, only three operational points will be evaluated.
