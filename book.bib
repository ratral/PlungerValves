  abstract = {In fluid dynamics, the Darcy friction factor formulae are equations that allow the calculation of the Darcy friction factor, a dimensionless quantity used in the Darcy\textendash Weisbach equation, for the description of friction losses in pipe flow as well as open-channel flow.
The Darcy friction factor is also known as the Darcy\textendash Weisbach friction factor, resistance coefficient or simply friction factor; by definition it is four times larger than the Fanning friction factor.},

  abstract = {In fluid dynamics, the Darcy\textendash Weisbach equation is an empirical equation, which relates the head loss, or pressure loss, due to friction along a given length of pipe to the average velocity of the fluid flow for an incompressible fluid. The equation is named after Henry Darcy and Julius Weisbach.
The Darcy\textendash Weisbach equation contains a dimensionless friction factor, known as the Darcy friction factor. This is also variously called the Darcy\textendash Weisbach friction factor, friction factor, resistance coefficient, or flow coefficient.},
