## Terms and definitions {#definitions}

- **Valve:** A valve is a device used for the control of fluid flow. It consists of a fluid retaining assembly, one or more ports between end openings and a movable closure member which opens, restricts or closes the port(s).

- **Control valve:** A operated (manual or powered) device which modifies the fluid flow rate in a process control system. It consists of a valve connected to an actuator mechanism that is capable of changing the position of a flow controlling element in the valve in response to a signal from the controlling system.
