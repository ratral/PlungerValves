# Introduction {#intro}

Plunger valves are mainly used where volume flows or pressure have to be reduced and regulated with out vibrations, noises or big changes in the pipeline system.

The following advantages are obtained from the plunger valves [@r.heiler]:

  - universal use wide controllable range;
  - low cavitation coefficient, stable flow, low noise;
  - flow block is variable: optimum flow for every operating conditions;
  - low drive forces with pressure-relieving fix and mobile cylinder (pistons);

Plunger valves are control devices that cause pressure loss in pipeline systems by throttling to throttling to modify the flow or pressure so that the desired values are obtained, depending on the degree of opening adjustment.

To size a control valve, the following points must be considered [@r.heiler]:

  - The control valve must be permit the maximum flow under the lowest-possible differential pressure.
  - The flow range (maximum, median and minimum) relative to the degree of opening of the control valve must be such that the regulation circuit is stable.
  - In the entire control range (maximum, median and minimum), there should be no occurrence of cavitation.
  - The pipeline systems are planned and installed, bearing in mind future requirements, and it is often forgotten that control valves designed for this end capacities are oversized at the start of the operation but not for the future requirements. Reducing the size of the control valve means generating additional costs in the future of system operation.

## Terms and definitions {#definitions}

```{definition, name="cavitation"}
A two-stage process associated with the flow of liquids. The first stage involves the formation of vapor bubbles in the flow stream as a result of the local static pressure in the flow stream dropping below the liquid vapor pressure. The second stage of the process is the subsequent collapse or implosion of the vapor cavities back to the liquid state when the local static pressure again becomes greater than the fluid vapor pressure [@ansi/isa1995].

```{definition, name="cavitation coefficient"}
A characteristic number for σ (e.g., $\sigma_{i}$, $\sigma_{c}$, $\sigma_{mv}$, $\sigma_{id}$, $\sigma_{ch}$), determined for a given valve, valve opening, and pressure conditions, which corresponds to the numerical value of the cavitation index at which the levels of incipient cavitation, constant cavitation, maximum vibration cavitation, incipient damage, and choking cavitation occur [@ansi/isa1995].
```

```{definition, name="cavitation index"}
The value for the operating service conditions of a valve, expressed as $\sigma_{}$ and numerically equal to $(p_1 - p_v )/(p_1 - p_2 )$ [@ansi/isa1995].
```

```{definition, name="cavitation level"}
The degree to which cavitation is occurring, i.e., incipient, constant, incipient damage, choking, or maximum vibration. Levels can be determined by testing for vibration, pitting or metal loss, and changes in valve capacity $(k_v)$ [@ansi/isa1995].
```

```{definition, name="choking cavitation"}
A limiting flow condition in which vapor formation is enough to limit the rate of flow through the valve to some maximum value. Further increases in flow rate through the valve are only possible by increasing the valve inlet pressure, because reducing downstream pressure will no longer increase flow rate [@ansi/isa1995].
```

```{definition, name="flashing"}
A flow condition in which vapor pockets formed inside a valve persist downstream of the valve because the valve outlet pressure is at or below the fluid vapor pressure [@ansi/isa1995].

```

```{definition, name="duty cycle"}
The ratio of the amount of time a valve spends performing one particular function to the valve's total installed time period. It may be expressed as a percentage of total time (service time vs. installed time) [@ansi/isa1995].
