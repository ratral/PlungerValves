Dr. Raúl Trujillo Álvarez 2020-08-30 Preface Structure of the document This document focuses on the sizing of plunger control valves in the transportation and distribution of drinking and raw water. It is recommended that readers have a basic understanding of hydraulic. Part I Theory introduces the fundamental usage and syntax, which should be sufficient to get most readers started in sizing a control valve. This part provides an overview of the basics hydraulic functions and is recommended reading for any new users of this document. Reading these documents does not exclude knowledge of the different European, American, and regional standards regarding control valve sizing. It is also necessary to have access to the norms, technical literature, and information of the producer about control valve sizing to delve into the different concepts. This document is a compilation of existing information in both European and American standards, in books and articles by different authors and articles by different manufacturers of valves. I have tried to cite all the above sources, but I apologize if, at any time, this has not correct. Also, apologize in advance if any of the mathematical functions have any errors. I ask that you please inform me to correct both the references to the different authors and the errors in the formulas. In part II praxis, I will concentrate on the development of examples, based on the information published by the different manufacturers of plunger valves. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Normative references 1.2 Nomenclature", " Chapter 1 Introduction Plunger valves are mainly used where volume flows or pressure have to be reduced and regulated with out vibrations, noises or big changes in the pipeline system. The following advantages are obtained from the plunger valves (Heiler, n.d.): universal use wide controllable range; low cavitation coefficient, stable flow, low noise; flow block is variable: optimum flow for every operating conditions; low drive forces with pressure-relieving fix and mobile cylinder (pistons); Plunger valves are control devices that cause pressure loss in pipeline systems by throttling to throttling to modify the flow or pressure so that the desired values are obtained, depending on the degree of opening adjustment. To size a control valve, the following points must be considered (Heiler, n.d.): The control valve must be permit the maximum flow under the lowest-possible differential pressure. The flow range (maximum, median and minimum) relative to the degree of opening of the control valve must be such that the regulation circuit is stable. In the entire control range (maximum, median and minimum), there should be no occurrence of cavitation. The pipeline systems are planned and installed, bearing in mind future requirements, and it is often forgotten that control valves designed for this end capacities are oversized at the start of the operation but not for the future requirements. Reducing the size of the control valve means generating additional problems and costs in the future of system operation. One of the most uncomfortable things that can a hydraulic design Ingenieur happens is a valve that he/she chose for six months ago deteriorate and having to listen to the unflattering comments made by the maintenance department. The most common causes of premature valve failure are: cavitation damage. cavitation and flashing of water (shock flow). erosion of the valve. vibration, (unstable flow pattern with liquids). corrosion. leakages (valve/actuator may be cycling). To avoid in any way, the following design criteria must be met (Baumann 2009): Criteria for valve selection : Is the valve appropriately sized? Does the valve have a low dead band, sometimes confused with hysteresis? Will it be able to operate without a positioner (also a cost factor)? Does it have adequate rangeability? Is the flow characteristic acceptable (installed characteristic)? How is its dynamic performance (frequency response, time constant)? Installation and affects on the environment: Is the face-to-face such that it can be replaced with another make? How heavy is it? Are supports needed? Is it too tall? Is it going to be noisy under the given flow conditions? Is there energy supply (in the case of electric actuators)? Can it withstand the corrosive effects of fluid and the environment? Would the valve be cavitating under the given flow conditions? If outdoors, can the valve and actuator stand extreme weather conditions? Maintainability and long-term cost: Is it easy to repair? What are the costs of spare parts? Can the actuator tolerate a vibrating environment? How is the actuator protected from corrosion? Is the packings field-replaceable? Is the control cylinders (fix and mobile) are field-replaceable? Is the actuator able to diagnose the valve? Another essential point to consider is the information available. Sizing the flow to the fifth place after the decimal point is all well and good, but only if you know the right process conditions (Baumann 2009): First of all, the valve should be sized to control the maximum flow rate under the lowest-possible differential pressure. But what is maximum flow this exactly? How about emergency conditions? On the other hand, should the valve fail full open, would the resultant flow be more than the downstream pipe or valve could handle? what is the correct inlet pressure? What are the variations in inlet pressure? Can you use the head pressure of the pump from the manufacturer’s published curve? (If you do, use the head pressure corresponding to the maximum flow the valve has to pass, and don’t ignore the static head at the pump’s location.) How about line losses? My experience is that all these questions will be answered in a vague form from the design people. They don’t know either and have to rely on the input from other departments. The result is usually guesswork with ample safety factors thrown in. Only after reviewing these criteria and deciding on the proper valve type should the subject of cost be considered. 1.1 Normative references The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document.

Do you need for the calculation of the valve flow factor (\\(k_{v}\\)) : operating pressure differential; flow rate for your application; Density of the fluid; and in some circumstances, temperature. 3.2 Flow coefficient \\(k_{v}\\) and Loss Coefficient \\(\\zeta_{v}\\) The valve flow coefficient \\(k_v\\) is defined as the number of cubic meters per hour of 5°C to 30°C water that will flow through a control valve at a specified position of the control valve (travel) \\(h\\) with a differential pressure (\\(\\Delta p=p_1-p_2\\)) of 105 Pa (1bar) across it. The standard conditions referred to in definitions of flow coefficients (\\(K_v\\)) are the following: flow in turbulent condition; no cavitation and vaporisation phenomena; valve diameter equal to pipe diameter; static pressure drop measured between upstream and downstream pressure taps; straight pipe lengths upstream and downstream the valve; Newtonian fluid. According to this European Standard, the flow rate characteristic parameter of a valve is the flow coefficient, \\(K_v\\). The equation, the quantity subject to measurement and input quantities are the following (Wagner 2008). \\[\\begin{equation} K_v = q \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac {(\\rho / \\rho_{0})}{\\Delta P}} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\Delta P\\) : operating pressure differential; \\(q\\) : flow rate for your application; \\(\\rho_{0}\\) : Density of Liquids; \\(d\\) Nominal size \\(K_v\\): Flow \\(m^3/hour\\) at \\(\\Delta P = 1 \\, bar\\) and in some circumstances, temperature \\(T\\). \\[\\begin{equation} K_{v} = q \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\Delta P }} = \\frac{q}{\\sqrt{\\Delta P}} \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] If the \\(\\zeta\\) value of the valve is : \\[\\begin{equation} \\zeta_{v} = {\\frac{1}{626.3} \\cdot \\bigg( {\\frac{d^2}{{K_v}}}} \\bigg)^2 \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] The \\(K_{v}\\) in function of the \\(\\zeta_{v}\\) is: \\[\\begin{equation} K_v = \\frac{d^2}{\\sqrt{626.3}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\zeta}} \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] 3.3 The flow basic characteristic curve (inherent flow characteristic). The characteristic of a control valve is defined as the flow rate depending on the position of the valve. The control valve generates a change in the flow by changing the active area of piston \\(A\\). To perform a required flow characteristic curve, it is necessary to determine the characteristic opening curve that delivers the needed flow rate, taking into account the variable area of the cylinder area, according to the path of the regulating cylinder. A unique assignment assumes a constant differential pressure \\(\\Delta p\\) and a constant density \\(\\rho\\). If the characteristic curve is determined under unit conditions, referred to below as the “basic characteristic curve”. The valve characteristic curve is a function of valve position (degree of opening) \\(vp\\) in percentage. The characteristic curve of a control valve is the dependence of the flow on the actuating path. If the characteristic curve is determined under unit conditions, then the flow rate is the \\(k_v\\) value. The basic characteristic of the control valves plus a cylinder will be (\\(K_v/K_{vs}\\)) depending on the position of the valve (\\(pv\\)). For the most precise interpretation in the function, we will use \\(x = valve \\; position\\) to define the valve position. \\[\\begin{equation} K_v/K_{vs} = f(x, (b, d, e)) \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] In this document, the characteristic curves are approximated by means of the Dose-Response Analysis (\\(dcr\\)). Dose-response models are regression models where the independent variable referred to as the dose, or in our case, the opening degree of a valve. In contrast, the dependent variable is generally referred to as response or effect. The full specification of a statistical dose-response (regression) model involves specifying how the mean is described by a parametric function of dose (valve position) as well as assumptions about the distribution of the response (\\(K_v\\)). A large number of more or less well-known model functions are building in \\(drc\\). These models are parameterized using a unified structure with the coefficients: \\(b\\) denoting the steepness of the dose-response curve, \\(c\\) (in this case 0) and \\(d\\) the lower and upper asymptotes or limits of the response, and, for some models, \\(e\\) the effective dose. By far the log-logistic models are the most used dose-response models. The four-parameter log-logistic model corresponds to the model function: \\[\\begin{equation} f(x, (b, d, e)) = \\frac{d}{1 + \\exp( b \\cdot (\\log{x} - \\log{e}))} \\tag{3.6} \\end{equation}\\] 3.4 Zeta value in function of the \\(K_v/K_{vs}\\) characteristic curve If (3.3) and (3.4) for \\(K_{vs}\\) then: \\[\\begin{equation} \\zeta_{v} = {\\frac{1}{626.3} \\cdot \\bigg( {\\frac{d^2}{{K_v}}}} \\bigg)^2 \\: ; \\: K_{v} = \\frac{d^2}{\\sqrt{626.3}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\zeta_{v}}} \\end{equation}\\] if \\[\\begin{equation} K_{v} = f(x, (b, d, e)) \\cdot K_{vs} \\\\ K_{v} = f(x, (b, d, e)) \\cdot \\frac{d^2}{\\sqrt{626.3}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\zeta_{vs}}} \\end{equation}\\] then \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{K_{v}^2} = \\frac{\\zeta_{vs}}{[f(x, (b, d, e))]^2} \\cdot \\frac{626.3}{d^4} \\\\ {\\frac{1}{626.3} \\cdot \\bigg( {\\frac{d^2}{{K_v}}}} \\bigg)^2 = \\frac{\\zeta_{vs}}{[f(vp\\%)]^2} \\end{equation}\\] then: \\[\\begin{equation} \\zeta_{v} = \\frac{\\zeta_{vs}}{[f(x, (b, d, e))]^2} \\tag{3.7} \\end{equation}\\] References "],

The equations outlined in this chapter are by the standards IEC 60534-2-1 and IEC 60534-2-3 (ANSI/ISA 2007). Choked flow is a limiting, or maximum, flow rate. With fixed inlet (upstream) conditions, it manifests by the failure of decreasing downstream pressure to increase the flow rate. Choking occurs as a result of the vaporization of the liquid. The vaporization occurs when the pressure within the valve falls below the vapor pressure of the fluid. Choked flow will be accompanied by either cavitation or flashing. If the downstream pressure is higher than the vapor pressure of the liquid, cavitation occurs. If the downstream pressure is equal to or less than the vapor pressure of the fluid, flashing occurs.This relationship between flow rate and pressure drop for a typical valve is shown in figure 4.1 (ANSI/ISA 1985). In general actual flow rate, \\(q_m\\) of a incompressible fluid through a valve is plotted in figure 4.1 versus the square root of the pressure differential \\(\\sqrt{\\Delta{P}}\\) under constant upstream conditions.

It is a measure of the amount of pressure recovered between the vena contracta and the valve outlet. This number will be high (0.9) for a globe style valve with a torturous follow path and lower (0.8 to 0.6) for a rotary style valve with a streamlined flow path. On most rotary products the \\(F_L\\) factor will vary with the degree of opening of the valve closure member (ANSI/ISA 1983). It is also important to understand that \\(F_L\\) is not a cavitation parameter. It is a choked flow parameter and its only use is to determine the theoretical choked flow point based on the assumption that the choked flow point, \\(\\sqrt{\\Delta P_{choked}}\\), is the intersection of the two straight dashed lines shown in Figures in red and green. Using \\(F_L\\) as a cavitation parameter is almost sure to result in unacceptable levels of cavitation damage. 4.4 Piping geometry factor \\(F_{p}\\) Definition 4.2 (Piping geometry factor) The piping geometry factor \\(F_{p}\\) accounts for fittings attached to either the valve inlet or the outlet that disturb the flow to the extent that valve capacity is affected. \\(F_P\\) is actually the ratio of the flow coefficient of a valve with attached fittings to the flow coefficient (\\(K_v\\)) of a valve installed in a straight pipe of the same size as the valve (ANSI/ISA 1985). Figure 4.3: Valve with fittings (Wagner 2008) \\(F_P\\), the factor for the pipe geometry, takes into account the influence of the fittings that are attached directly to the inlet and/or outlet of a control valve (figure 4.3). The \\(F_P\\) factor is the ratio of the flow rate of a control valve with fittings to the flow rate that would result if the control valve were tested without fittings under identical conditions (Wagner 2008) and (ANSI/ISA 2007). \\[\\begin{equation} F_{P} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{\\sum{\\zeta} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{K_v}{d^2} \\right)^2}{0.00214}}} = \\left( \\frac{\\sum{\\zeta} \\cdot K_v^2}{0.00214 \\cdot d^4} + 1 \\right)^{-1/2} \\tag{4.5} \\end{equation}\\] In this equation, the factor \\(\\sum \\zeta\\) is the algebraic sum of all effective resistance coefficients of all fittings that are attached to the control valve. This does not include the drag coefficient of the control valve itself. \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum{\\zeta} = (\\zeta_{1} + \\zeta_{2}) + (\\zeta_{B_1} - \\zeta_{B_2}) \\tag{4.6} \\end{equation}\\] Where: \\(\\zeta_{1}\\) resistance coefficient of the valve in the inlet \\(\\zeta_{2}\\) resistance coefficient of the valve in the outlet \\(\\zeta_{B_1}\\) Bernoulli pressure number in the valve inlet \\(\\zeta_{B_2}\\) Bernoulli pressure number in the valve outlet If the diameters of the inlet and outlet fittings are the same, \\(\\zeta_{B_1}\\) and \\(\\zeta_{B_1}\\) become equal and fall out of the equation. In cases where the pipe diameters in front of and behind the control valve are different, the \\(\\zeta_{coefficients}\\) are calculated as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\zeta_{B_1} = 1- \\left( \\frac{d}{D_1} \\right)^4 \\tag{4.7} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\zeta_{B_2} = 1- \\left( \\frac{d}{D_2} \\right)^4 \\tag{4.8} \\end{equation}\\] If the inlet and outlet ports are short, commercially available concentric reducers and diffusers, then the coefficients \\(\\zeta_1\\) and \\(\\zeta_2\\) can be calculated roughly as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\zeta_1 = 0.5 \\cdot \\left( 1 - \\left( \\frac{d}{D_1}\\right)^2 \\right)^2 \\tag{4.9} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\zeta_2 = \\left( 1 - \\left( \\frac{d}{D_2}\\right)^2 \\right)^2 \\tag{4.10} \\end{equation}\\] Then for inlet reduction and outlet expansion with the same pipe size: \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum \\zeta = \\zeta_1 + \\zeta_2 = 1.5 \\cdot \\left( 1 - \\left( \\frac{d}{D_1}\\right)^2 \\right)^2 \\tag{4.11} \\end{equation}\\] 4.5 Combined liquid pressure recovery factor \\(F_{LP}\\) When a valve is installed with reducers or other attached fittings, the liquid pressure recovery of the valve-fitting combination is not the same as that for the valve alone. For calculations involving choked flow, it is convenient to treat the piping geometry factor \\(F_p\\) and the \\(F_L\\) factor for the valve-fitting combination as a single factor. The factor \\(F_{LP}\\) is determined in the same way as FL, with laboratory test results (For maximum accuracy, F LP must be determined by using the test procedures specified in [ANSI/ISA (1996)}). If the permissible deviation is to remain ≤ 5%, \\(F_{LP}\\) must be determined through tests. If estimates are allowed, sufficient accuracy can be achieved by using the following equation (Wagner 2008) and (ANSI/ISA 2007): \\[\\begin{equation} F_{LP} = \\frac{F_L}{\\sqrt{1 + F_L \\cdot \\frac{\\sum{\\zeta} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{K_v}{d^2} \\right)^2}{0.00214}}} = F_L \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\sum{\\zeta} \\cdot F_L^2 \\cdot K_v^2}{0.00214 \\cdot d^4} + 1 \\right)^{-1/2} \\tag{4.12} \\end{equation}\\] 4.6 Reynolds number factor \\(F_{R}\\) Definition 4.3 (Reynolds number factor) The Reynolds number factor \\(F_R\\) is required when non-turbulent flow conditions are established through a control valve because of a low pressure differential, a high viscosity, a very small flow coefficient, or a combination thereof. \\(F_{R}\\), the correction factor for the influence of the Reynolds number, is to be used for non-turbulent flow in the control valve because there is either a low differential pressure or a highly viscous liquid or a very low flow coefficient or a combination thereof. The \\(F_{R}\\) factor is determined by dividing the flow coefficient for non-turbulent flow conditions by the flow coefficient determined under the same installation conditions under turbulent circumstances. If no test results are available, \\(F_{R}\\) can be determined from the curve according to figure 4.4 by using a valve Reynolds number that is calculated from the following equation (Wagner 2008): \\[\\begin{equation} Re_v = \\frac{7.07 \\cdot 10^4 \\cdot F_d \\cdot Q}{\\upsilon \\cdot \\sqrt{F_p \\cdot F_L \\cdot K_v}} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{{F_P}^2 \\cdot {F_L}^2 {K_v}^2 }{0.0016 \\cdot D^4} + 1 \\right) \\tag{4.13} \\end{equation}\\] with: \\(\\upsilon\\) in \\([mm^2 / s ]\\) Values for \\(F_d\\): 0.7 for control valves with two parallel flow paths; 1.0 for valves with a V-shaped throttle cross-section, normal single-seat, and ball valves. Figure 4.4: Reynolds number factor for valve sizing (ANSI/ISA 1985) 4.7 \\(F_F\\) is the Liquid critical pressure ratio factor Definition 4.4 (Liquid critical pressure ratio factor) \\(F_F\\) is the liquid critical pressure ratio factor. This factor is the ratio of the apparent vena contracta pressure at choked flow conditions to the vapor pressure of the liquid at inlet temperature. At vapor pressures near zero, this factor is \\(0.96\\). Values of \\(F_F\\) may be determined approximated from the following equation: \\[\\begin{equation} F_F = 0.96 - 0.28 \\cdot \\sqrt{p_v / p_c} \\tag{4.14} \\end{equation}\\] Where: \\(p_c\\) is the thermodynamic critical pressure.

Usually the beginning of cavitation is identified by the coefficient of incipient cavitation \\(X_{FZ}\\) : The coefficient of constant cavitation \\(K_C\\) identifies where the cavitation begins to appear in water flow through the control valve with such an intensity that, under constant upstream conditions, the flow rate deviation from the linearity versus \\(\\sqrt{\\Delta{P}}\\) exceeds 2%. A simple calculation rule uses the formula: \\[\\begin{equation} K_C = 0.80 \\cdot {F_L}^2 \\tag{4.16} \\end{equation}\\] The coefficient of incipient cavitation \\(X_{FZ}\\) identifies the beginning of cavitation. The \\(X_{FZ}\\) coefficient can be determined by a test using sound level meters or accelerometers connected to the pipe and relating noise and vibration increase with the beginning of bubble formation [IEC 60534-8-2 “Laboratory measurement of the noise generated by a liquid flow through a control valve”].

["quantifying-the-cavitation-potential-of-the-valve.html", "Chapter 5 Quantifying the Cavitation Potential of the valve 5.1 Evaluating the Cavitation Limits of the valve", " Chapter 5 Quantifying the Cavitation Potential of the valve Its effect on the system varies with valve type, size, operating pressure, and details of the piping installation. To include cavitation in the design process is necessary to determine if cavitation will it’s, evaluate its intensity, characterize the flow conditions, and estimate its effect on the system and environment. Possible consequences include noise, vibration, erosion damage, and a decrease in performance. In the case of control valves it is conventional to describe the application in terms of a single parameter and then to compare this parameter to different limits of operation for a given control element. To characterize the flow conditions corresponding to a selected level of cavitation requires defining a cavitation index derived from dimensional analysis. The process involves determining the fluid properties, geometric characteristics, and fluid parameters that influence the cavitation process. The main variables affecting the cavitation process are: the geometric configuration of the device, absolute pressure in the cavitating region, the critical pressure, generally assumed to be the liquid vapor pressure and velocity or pressure drop The cavitation index sigma \\(\\sigma\\) is a form of another dimensionless parameter.Sigma is constant for either SI or US Customary units as long as the same units of pressure are used throughout the equations for the parameter. This index (σ) is the ratio of fluid forces trying to prevent cavitation (the system or service pressure) to the forces trying to cause cavitation (the pressure drop). The smaller the value of the cavitation index for a flow system, the more likely or the more severe cavitation will be. The force suppressing cavitation is proportional to the magnitude of the average pressure relative to absolute vapor pressure i.e. \\((P-P_r)\\). The force causing cavitation is proportional to the velocity head \\(V^2/2g\\) or to the pressure drop across the valve \\(\\Delta P\\). The resulting cavitation parameter sigma can be expressed as (Tullis 1993): \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma = \\frac{P_1-P_v}{\\Delta P_{net}} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] in which: \\(P_1\\) is the absolute pressure just upstream from the valve \\((P_l = P_u + P_b)\\), \\(P_u\\) is the gauge pressure just upstream from the valve, \\(P_b\\) is the atmospheric or barometric pressure, \\(P_v\\) is the absolute vapor pressure and \\(\\Delta P_{net}\\) the net pressure drop across the valve. The minimum value of sigma (\\(\\sigma\\)) is \\(1.0\\) since the maximum \\(\\Delta P_{net}\\) across the valve is \\((P_1 - P_v)\\). For valves and other devices that create a pressure drop, the cavitation parameter can be defined in several ways. The reference pressure in the numerator of the equation of sigma equation (5.1) can be either the upstream or the downstream pressure. Both have been used, and there are valid reasons supporting either choice. Using the downstream pressure \\(P_2\\), the equation becomes: \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma_{1} = \\frac{P_2-P_v}{\\Delta P_{net}} \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] In which \\(P_2\\) is the absolute downstream pressure (\\(P_2 = P_d + P_b\\)), where \\(P_d = P_u - \\Delta P_{net}\\) and \\(P_b\\) is the barometric pressure. This is the form originally preferred because the downstream pressure is the pressure closer to the zone where the cavitation occurs. Therefore, the downstream pressure more directly influences the cavitation. However, it is more convenient to use the upstream pressure for most applications, and the two sigma values differ by a constant value of \\(1.0\\). The following simple equation directly relates the equation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma = \\sigma_{1} + 1 \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] For cavitation caused by surface roughness, an isolated roughness, an offset in the boundary or by any device for which it is not possible or convenient to evaluate a pressure differential, the velocity head can be used in place of \\(\\Delta{P}\\) in Equation of \\(\\sigma\\). The resulting equation is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma_{2} = \\frac{P_1-P_v}{(V^2/2g)} \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] Some authors have chosen to use the reciprocal of Equation for \\(\\sigma\\) and have defined the cavitation index as \\(K_c\\) instead of \\(\\sigma\\). The equation defining \\(K_c\\) is: \\[\\begin{equation} K_c = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{1}} = \\frac{\\Delta P_{net}}{(P_2-P_v)} \\tag{5.5} \\end{equation}\\] If you want to add a factor of safety to the cavitation parameter \\(\\sigma\\) (5.1) that includes the possible cavitation caused by any device for which it is not possible or convenient to evaluate a pressure differential close to the control valve, then: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{}} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{2}} &amp; = \\frac{\\Delta P_{net}}{(P_1-P_v)} + \\frac{(V^2/2g)}{(P_1-P_v)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{\\Delta P_{net} + (V^2/2g)}{(P_1-P_v)} \\end{split} \\end{equation}\\] So: \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma_{3} = \\frac{(P_1-P_v)}{\\Delta P_{net} + (V^2/2g)} \\tag{5.6} \\end{equation}\\] 5.1 Evaluating the Cavitation Limits of the valve Cavitation causes noise, pressure fluctuations, vibrations, erosion damage, and in advanced stages, can reduce the valve’s capacity. The acceptable cavitation level for a valve in a given system varies with valve type, valve function, details of the piping layout and duration of the operation. It is necessary to identify and provide experimental data for several levels of cavitation intensity to have adequate information for analysis and design. There are defined six different cavitation design limits. The methods used to determine each limit experimentally are described, and suggestions are given as to when each limit might be appropriate. These limits are: Incipient cavitation \\(\\sigma_{i}\\) Critical (or constant) cavitation \\(\\sigma_{c}\\) Incipient damage \\(\\sigma_{i_d}\\) Incipient choking \\(\\sigma_{i_{ch}}\\) (or Kc) Choked flow \\(\\sigma_{ch}\\) Maximum noise and vibration level \\(\\sigma_{max}\\) Definition 5.1 (cavitation) A two-stage process associated with the flow of liquids. The first stage involves the formation of vapor bubbles in the flow stream as a result of the local static pressure in the flow stream dropping below the liquid vapor pressure. The second stage of the process is the subsequent collapse or implosion of the vapor cavities back to the liquid state when the local static pressure again becomes greater than the fluid vapor pressure (ANSI/ISA 1995). Definition 5.2 (cavitation coefficient) A characteristic number for σ (e.g., \\(\\sigma_{i}\\), \\(\\sigma_{c}\\), \\(\\sigma_{mv}\\), \\(\\sigma_{id}\\), \\(\\sigma_{ch}\\)), determined for a given valve, valve opening, and pressure conditions, which corresponds to the numerical value of the cavitation index at which the levels of incipient cavitation, constant cavitation, maximum vibration cavitation, incipient damage, and choking cavitation occur (ANSI/ISA 1995). Definition 5.3 (cavitation index) The value for the operating service conditions of a valve, expressed as \\(\\sigma_{}\\) and numerically equal to \\((p_1 - p_v )/(p_1 - p_2 )\\) (ANSI/ISA 1995). Definition 5.4 (cavitation level) The degree to which cavitation is occurring, i.e., incipient, constant, incipient damage, choking, or maximum vibration. Levels can be determined by testing for vibration, pitting or metal loss, and changes in valve capacity \\((k_v)\\) (ANSI/ISA 1995). Definition 5.5 (choking cavitation) A limiting flow condition in which vapor formation is enough to limit the rate of flow through the valve to some maximum value. Further increases in flow rate through the valve are only possible by increasing the valve inlet pressure, because reducing downstream pressure will no longer increase flow rate (ANSI/ISA 1995). Definition 5.6 (flashing) A flow condition in which vapor pockets formed inside a valve persist downstream of the valve because the valve outlet pressure is at or below the fluid vapor pressure (ANSI/ISA 1995). Definition 5.7 (duty cycle) The ratio of the amount of time a valve spends performing one particular function to the valve’s total installed time period. It may be expressed as a percentage of total time (service time vs. installed time) (ANSI/ISA 1995). SIGMA Values: Incipient cavitation. (\\(\\sigma_{i}\\)): • Onset of cavitation • Detect using high frequency vibration measurement • Very local phenomenon • Transient: random “ticks” sound • Low level cavitation: usually not damaging • Occurs prior to loss of capacity Constant cavitation (\\(\\sigma_{c}\\)): • More regular cavitation events • Lower frequency sound and vibration sensed: “rumbling” sound • Some damage to surfaces may occur: dependent upon valve and trim styles, and materials. Maximum Cavitation (\\(\\sigma_{mv}\\)): • Highest vibration amplitude: sounds like “marbles” or “gravel” • Vigorous, large scale cavitation • Predicted by steady flow pressure distribution ( = \\(F_L\\) ) • Very high damage potential Manufacturer’s Recommended Limit (\\(\\sigma_{mr}\\)) References "],
["inherent-and-installed-flow-characteristics.html", "Chapter 6 Inherent and installed flow characteristics", " Chapter 6 Inherent and installed flow characteristics First: After the valve is installed into a piping system, the above flow characteristics are only applicable when: the pressure drop upstream and downstream remains constant with flow changes. there are be no onset of flashing or cavitation at certain flow conditions; and the valve isn’t installed between reducer. As you can see from the above, this is ideal conditions that will be only possible in the manufacturer’s flow lab. So, we have to deal with the “installed flow characteristic.” The installed flow characteristic is the relationship of flowing quantity to valve travel, accounting for the difference in pressure drop between the maximum and minimum flow, and the distortion that the reducer head losses create in the inherent valve flow characteristic. This installed characteristic is what finally affects the controller stability (Baumann 2009). In another form, The relationship between the valve stem position and the flow rate through a control valve is the characteristic of the valve. An equal percentage flow characteristic is a non-linear curve whose slope increases as the valve opens; A linear flow characteristic is a straight line. Control valves manipulate the rate of liquid flow through them by altering the open area through which the liquid passes. Linear valves increase open area linearly with valve travel, while equal percentage valves progressively open more area with the valve travel. References "],
