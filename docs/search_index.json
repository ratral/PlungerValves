Step 1. Specify the variables required to size the valve. Step 2. Read the values of the selected valve. Step 3. Determine the flow coefficient \\(k_v\\), the opening degree for the flow and \\(F_L\\). Step 4. Determine the pressure drop to use for sizing (\\(\\Delta{P_{sizing}}).\\) Step 5. Calculate the required flow coefficient (\\(K_v\\)). 5.1.1 Step 1. Specify the variables required to size the valve. Service data : 1. Water pressure must be managed from 30 bars to 6 bars. 2. The control valve has a diameter of 250 mm and is smaller than the diameters of the pipe upstream (250 mm) and downstream (250 mm) of the valve. physical constants: Fluid : Water Water Temperature : 23.3 Â°C Altitude: 0 msal.
