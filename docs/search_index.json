Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Example 2. The objective of this exercise is to select between three possible types of control valves (the same valve but different types of cylinders) the most suitable for the operation of the system. The conditions are as follows: the diameter of the valve is smaller than the diameter of the pipes; the system requires a constant flow, the pressures upstream and downstream of the valve vary during the operation of the system; Initially, only three operational points will be evaluated. The steps to follow are those: Step 1. Specify the variables required to size the valve. Step 2. Determine the equation constants. Step 3. Determine the piping geometry factor (\\(F_P\\)). Step 4. Determine the pressure drop to use for sizing (\\(\\Delta{P_{sizing}}).\\) Step 5. Calculate the required flow coefficient (\\(K_v\\)). 6.1 Step 1. Specify the variables required to size the valve. The flow should be a constant 9396 \\(m^3/h\\) (2.61 \\(m^3/s\\)). The control valve has a diameter of 1000 mm and is smaller than the diameters of the pipe upstream (1400 mm) and downstream (1200 mm) of the valve.

Conclusion the initial conclusions would be the following: Only type 1 and 2 valves meet the required conditions; With the information of the minimum, average and maximum values, only a first approximation of the behavior of the valve is achieved. And it is used for the preselection of the type of valve required. Depending on the importance of the valve for the operation of the system, it is recommended to know all the values corresponding to all the operating scenarios. This exercise is derived from the actual selection of two control valves on a water treatment plant. The valves are used to control the backwashing of the filters, and for this reason, it is extremely important to review all operating scenarios (see Example xx). References "]
