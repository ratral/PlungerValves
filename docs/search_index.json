The first stage involves the formation of vapor bubbles in the flow stream as a result of the local static pressure in the flow stream dropping below the liquid vapor pressure. The second stage of the process is the subsequent collapse or implosion of the vapor cavities back to the liquid state when the local static pressure again becomes greater than the fluid vapor pressure. cavitation coefficient: A characteristic number for σ (e.g., \\(\\sigma_{i}\\), \\(\\sigma_{c}\\), \\(\\sigma_{mv}\\), \\(\\sigma_{id}\\), \\(\\sigma_{ch}\\)), determined for a given valve, valve opening, and pressure conditions, which corresponds to the numerical value of the cavitation index at which the levels of incipient cavitation, constant cavitation, maximum vibration cavitation, incipient damage, and choking cavitation occur. cavitation index: The value for the operating service conditions of a valve, expressed as \\(\\sigma_{}\\) and numerically equal to \\((p_1 - p_v )/(p_1 - p_2 )\\). cavitation level: The degree to which cavitation is occurring, i.e., incipient, constant, incipient damage, choking, or maximum vibration. Levels can be determined by testing for vibration, pitting or metal loss, and changes in valve capacity \\((k_v)\\). choking cavitation: A limiting flow condition in which vapor formation is enough to limit the rate of flow through the valve to some maximum value. Further increases in flow rate through the valve are only possible by increasing the valve inlet pressure, because reducing downstream pressure will no longer increase flow rate. duty cycle: The ratio of the amount of time a valve spends performing one particular function to the valve’s total installed time period. It may be expressed as a percentage of total time (service time vs. installed time). flashing: A flow condition in which vapor pockets formed inside a valve persist downstream of the valve because the valve outlet pressure is at or below the fluid vapor pressure. Valve: A valve is a device used for the control of fluid flow. It consists of a fluid retaining assembly, one or more ports between end openings and a movable closure member which opens, restricts or closes the port(s). Control valve: A operated (manual or powered) device which modifies the fluid flow rate in a process control system. It consists of a valve connected to an actuator mechanism that is capable of changing the position of a flow controlling element in the valve in response to a signal from the controlling system. "],

It is necessary to identify and provide experimental data for several levels of cavitation intensity to have adequate information for analysis and design.

["quantifying-the-cavitation-potential-of-the-valve.html", "Chapter 5 Quantifying the Cavitation Potential of the valve", " Chapter 5 Quantifying the Cavitation Potential of the valve Its effect on the system varies with valve type, size, operating pressure, and details of the piping installation. To include cavitation in the design process is necessary to determine if cavitation will it’s, evaluate its intensity, characterize the flow conditions, and estimate its effect on the system and environment. Possible consequences include noise, vibration, erosion damage, and a decrease in performance. In the case of control valves it is conventional to describe the application in terms of a single parameter and then to compare this parameter to different limits of operation for a given control element. To characterize the flow conditions corresponding to a selected level of cavitation requires defining a cavitation index derived from dimensional analysis. The process involves determining the fluid properties, geometric characteristics, and fluid parameters that influence the cavitation process. The main variables affecting the cavitation process are: the geometric configuration of the device, absolute pressure in the cavitating region, the critical pressure, generally assumed to be the liquid vapor pressure and velocity or pressure drop The cavitation index sigma \\(\\sigma\\) is a form of another dimensionless parameter.Sigma is constant for either SI or US Customary units as long as the same units of pressure are used throughout the equations for the parameter. This index (σ) is the ratio of fluid forces trying to prevent cavitation (the system or service pressure) to the forces trying to cause cavitation (the pressure drop). The smaller the value of the cavitation index for a flow system, the more likely or the more severe cavitation will be. The force suppressing cavitation is proportional to the magnitude of the average pressure relative to absolute vapor pressure i.e. \\((P-P_r)\\). The force causing cavitation is proportional to the velocity head \\(V^2/2g\\) or to the pressure drop across the valve \\(\\Delta P\\). The resulting cavitation parameter sigma can be expressed as (using absolute units): \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma = \\frac{P_1-P_v}{\\Delta P_{net}} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] in which: \\(P_1\\) is the absolute pressure just upstream from the valve \\((P_l = P_u + P_b)\\), \\(P_u\\) is the gauge pressure just upstream from the valve, \\(P_b\\) is the atmospheric or barometric pressure, \\(P_v\\) is the absolute vapor pressure and \\(\\Delta P_{net}\\) the net pressure drop across the valve. The minimum value of sigma (\\(\\sigma\\)) is \\(1.0\\) since the maximum \\(\\Delta P_{net}\\) across the valve is \\((P_1 - P_v)\\). For valves and other devices that create a pressure drop, the cavitation parameter can be defined in several ways. The reference pressure in the numerator of the equation of sigma equation (5.1) can be either the upstream or the downstream pressure. Both have been used, and there are valid reasons supporting either choice. Using the downstream pressure \\(P_2\\), the equation becomes: \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma_{1} = \\frac{P_2-P_v}{\\Delta P_{net}} \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] In which \\(P_2\\) is the absolute downstream pressure (\\(P_2 = P_d + P_b\\)), where \\(P_d = P_u - \\Delta P_{net}\\) and \\(P_b\\) is the barometric pressure. This is the form originally preferred because the downstream pressure is the pressure closer to the zone where the cavitation occurs. Therefore, the downstream pressure more directly influences the cavitation. However, it is more convenient to use the upstream pressure for most applications, and the two sigma values differ by a constant value of \\(1.0\\). The following simple equation directly relates the equation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma = \\sigma_{1} + 1 \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] For cavitation caused by surface roughness, an isolated roughness, an offset in the boundary or by any device for which it is not possible or convenient to evaluate a pressure differential, the velocity head can be used in place of \\(\\Delta{P}\\) in Equation of \\(\\sigma\\). The resulting equation is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma_{2} = \\frac{P_1-P_v}{(V^2/2g)} \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] Some authors have chosen to use the reciprocal of Equation for \\(\\sigma\\) and have defined the cavitation index as \\(K_c\\) instead of \\(\\sigma\\). The equation defining \\(K_c\\) is: \\[\\begin{equation} K_c = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{1}} = \\frac{\\Delta P_{net}}{(P_2-P_v)} \\tag{5.5} \\end{equation}\\] If you want to add a factor of safety to the cavitation parameter \\(\\sigma\\) (5.1) that includes the possible cavitation caused by any device for which it is not possible or convenient to evaluate a pressure differential close to the control valve, then: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{}} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{2}} &amp; = \\frac{\\Delta P_{net}}{(P_1-P_v)} + \\frac{(V^2/2g)}{(P_1-P_v)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{\\Delta P_{net} + (V^2/2g)}{(P_1-P_v)} \\end{split} \\end{equation}\\] So: \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma_{3} = \\frac{(P_1-P_v)}{\\Delta P_{net} + (V^2/2g)} \\tag{5.6} \\end{equation}\\] "],
