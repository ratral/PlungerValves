## The _Flow coefficient_ $k_{v}$ 

Flow factor $k_{v}$  combines the effects of all flow restrictions in the valve into a single number.
$k_{v}$ represents the flow of water with temperature ranging between $5째C$ and $30째C$ through a valve in cubic meters per hour with a pressure drop of $1 bar$ [@wagner2008].

Do you need for the calculation of the valve flow factor ($k_{v}$) : 

 - operating pressure differential; 
 - flow rate for your application; 
 - Density of the fluid; 
 - and in some circumstances, temperature. 

## _Flow coefficient_ $k_{v}$ and _Loss Coefficient_ $\zeta_{v}$ 

The valve flow coefficient $k_v$ is defined as the number of cubic meters per hour of 5째C to 30째C water that will flow through a control valve at a specified position of the control valve (travel) $h$ with a differential pressure ($\Delta p=p_1-p_2$) of 105 Pa (1bar) across it.

The standard conditions referred to in definitions of flow coefficients ($K_v$) are the following:

  - flow in turbulent condition;
  - no cavitation and vaporisation phenomena;
  - valve diameter equal to pipe diameter;
  - static pressure drop measured between upstream and downstream pressure taps;
  - straight pipe lengths upstream and downstream the valve;
  - Newtonian fluid.

According to this European Standard, the flow rate characteristic parameter of a valve is the flow coefficient, $K_v$. The equation, the quantity subject to measurement and input quantities are the following [@wagner2008].

\begin{equation} 
  K_v = q \cdot \sqrt{\frac {(\rho / \rho_{0})}{\Delta P}} 
  (\#eq:Kv-01)
\end{equation} 

 - $\Delta P$ : operating pressure differential; 
 - $q$ : flow rate for your application; 
 - $\rho_{0}$ : Density of Liquids; 
 - $d$ Nominal size 
 - $K_v$: Flow $m^3/hour$ at $\Delta P = 1 \, bar$    
 - and in some circumstances, temperature $T$. 


\begin{equation} 
  K_{v} = q \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{\Delta P }} = \frac{q}{\sqrt{\Delta P}}
  (\#eq:Kv-02)
\end{equation} 

 - If the $\zeta$ value of the valve is : 

\begin{equation}
  \zeta_{v} = {\frac{1}{626.3} \cdot  \bigg( {\frac{d^2}{{K_v}}}} \bigg)^2
  (\#eq:zeta-01)
\end{equation} 

  - The $K_{v}$ in function of the $\zeta_{v}$ is:
  
\begin{equation}
  K_v = \frac{d^2}{\sqrt{626.3}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\zeta}}
  (\#eq:Kv-03)  
\end{equation} 

## The flow basic characteristic curve (inherent flow characteristic).
The characteristic of a control valve is defined as the flow rate depending on the valve's position. The control valve generates a change in the flow by changing the active area of control piston $A$, assuming a constant differential pressure $\Delta p$ and a constant density $\rho$.

If the characteristic curve is determined under unit conditions, referred to below as the _"basic characteristic curve"_. The valve characteristic curve is a function of valve position (degree of opening) $vp$ in percentage. The basic characteristic of the control valves ($K_v/K_{vs}$) depend of the position of the valve ($pv$).

$$
  K_v/K_{vs} = f(x, (b, d, e))
$$

In this document, the characteristic curves are approximated by means of the  [Dose-Response Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose%E2%80%93response_relationship) $(dcr)$.  Dose-response models are regression models where the independent variable referred to as the dose, or in our case, the opening degree of a valve. In contrast, the dependent variable is generally referred to as response or effect. 

The full specification of a statistical dose-response (regression) model involves specifying how the mean is described by a parametric function of dose (valve position) as well as assumptions about the distribution of the response ($K_v/K_{vs}$).

A large number of more or less well-known model functions are building in $drc$.  These models are parameterized using a unified structure with the coefficients: 

  - $b$ denoting the steepness of the dose-response curve, 
  - $d$ is the lower and upper asymptotes or limits of the response, and, 
  - for some models, $e$ the effective dose. 

By far the log-logistic models are the most used dose-response models. The three-parameter log-logistic model corresponds to the function:

\begin{equation}
  f(x, (b, d, e)) =  \frac{d}{1 + \exp( b \cdot (\log{x} - \log{e}))}
  (\#eq:Dose-response-model)  
\end{equation} 

## Zeta value in function of the $K_v/K_{vs}$ characteristic curve

If \@ref(eq:zeta-01) and \@ref(eq:Kv-03) for $K_{vs}$ then:


\begin{equation}
  \zeta_{v} = {\frac{1}{626.3} \cdot  \bigg( {\frac{d^2}{{K_v}}}} \bigg)^2 \: ; \: 
  K_{v} = \frac{d^2}{\sqrt{626.3}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\zeta_{v}}}
\end{equation} 

if

\begin{equation}
  K_{v} = f(x, (b, d, e)) \cdot K_{vs} \\ K_{v} = f(x, (b, d, e)) \cdot  \frac{d^2}{\sqrt{626.3}} \cdot     \frac{1}{\sqrt{\zeta_{vs}}}
\end{equation} 

then

\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{K_{v}^2} = \frac{\zeta_{vs}}{[f(x, (b, d, e))]^2} \cdot \frac{626.3}{d^4} \\
  {\frac{1}{626.3} \cdot  \bigg( {\frac{d^2}{{K_v}}}} \bigg)^2 = \frac{\zeta_{vs}}{[f(vp\%)]^2}
\end{equation} 

then:

\begin{equation}
  \zeta_{v} = \frac{\zeta_{vs}}{[f(x, (b, d, e))]^2}
  (\#eq:zeta-02)
\end{equation}
